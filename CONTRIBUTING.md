## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Always use TypeScript** - No plain JavaScript files
- **Define types explicitly** - Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- **Use interfaces** for object shapes
- **Export types** that are used across multiple files

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };

// ‚ùå Bad
const user: any = { id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
```

### React Components

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **One component per file** (except for small, tightly-coupled components)
- **Name files** with PascalCase (e.g., `GuestDetail.tsx`)
- **Export default** for main component
- **Use named exports** for utility functions

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export default function GuestDetail({ guest }: GuestDetailProps) {
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
  // ...
}

// ‚ùå Bad
const GuestDetail = (props) => {
  // ...
}
export default GuestDetail;
```

### Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- **Avoid inline styles** unless dynamic
- **Keep consistent spacing** (use Tailwind's spacing scale)
- **Follow mobile-first** approach

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700">
  Save
</button>

// ‚ùå Bad
<button style={{ padding: '8px 16px', background: '#2563eb' }}>
  Save
</button>
```

### File Organization

```typescript
// Component file structure:
// 1. Imports
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface Props {
  // ...
}

// 3. Component
export default function Component({ prop }: Props) {
  // 3.1 State
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  
  // 3.2 Effects
  useEffect(() => {}, []);
  
  // 3.3 Handlers
  const handleClick = () => {};
  
  // 3.4 Render
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### Code Quality

- **Run linter** before committing: `npm run lint`
- **Type check** your code: `npm run typecheck`
- **Format consistently** - Consider using Prettier
- **Write meaningful comments** for complex logic
- **Remove console.logs** before committing (except in error handlers)

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

Although we don't have tests yet, here's what we expect:

```typescript
// Example test structure
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import GuestList from './GuestList';

describe('GuestList', () => {
  it('renders guest list correctly', () => {
    const guests = [
      { id: '1', family_name: 'Smith', room_number: '101', country: 'USA', pax: 2, nights: 3 }
    ];
    
    render(<GuestList guests={guests} onSelectGuest={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Smith')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Room 101')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('calls onSelectGuest when guest is clicked', () => {
    const mockSelect = jest.fn();
    // ... test implementation
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit tests**: For utility functions and validation logic
- **Component tests**: For React components
- **Integration tests**: For key user flows
- **Target coverage**: >80%

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Comments

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Explains WHY
// Calculate week of month accounting for partial weeks at start
const weekNumber = Math.floor((date + firstDayOfWeek) / 7) + 1;

// ‚ùå Bad - Explains WHAT (obvious from code)
// Add 1 to the result
const weekNumber = calculateWeek(date) + 1;
```

### README Updates

When adding features:
- Update the Features section
- Add to API Reference if applicable
- Update screenshots if UI changed
- Update installation steps if needed

### JSDoc for Complex Functions

```typescript
/**
 * Validates guest data before saving to database
 * @param guest - Partial guest object to validate
 * @returns Validation result with errors array
 * @example
 * const result = validateGuest({ family_name: '', room_number: '101' });
 * if (!result.isValid) {
 *   console.error(result.errors);
 * }
 */
export function validateGuest(guest: Partial<Guest>): ValidationResult {
  // ...
}
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Supabase Interactions

- **Always handle errors** from Supabase calls
- **Use try-catch** for async operations
- **Show user feedback** (toast notifications)
- **Log errors** for debugging

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from('guests').select('*');
  if (error) throw error;
  setGuests(data);
  toast.success('Guests loaded successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error loading guests:', error);
  toast.error('Failed to load guests');
}

// ‚ùå Bad
const { data } = await supabase.from('guests').select('*');
setGuests(data);
```

### Form Validation

- **Always validate** user input
- **Use validation utilities** from `utils/validation.ts`
- **Show inline errors** for better UX
- **Prevent submission** if invalid

### State Management

- **Use local state** for component-specific data
- **Lift state up** when needed by multiple components
- **Consider context** for deeply nested prop drilling
- **Keep state minimal** - derive what you can
